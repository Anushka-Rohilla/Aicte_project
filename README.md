SECURE DATA HIDING IN IMAGES USING STEGANOGRAPHY

Overview

This project implements steganography techniques to hide secret messages within images. Using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, messages can be encoded and decoded without noticeable changes to the image. The project supports multiple image formats and ensures data security. It provides a simple interface for encoding and decoding messages. Future enhancements aim to improve security and usability.

Features

1.Encode text messages into images

2.Decode hidden messages from images

3.Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG, BMP)

4.Simple and user-friendly interface

5.Secure message encoding using least significant bit (LSB) technique

Technologies Used

1. Python - For simplicity, powerful libraries and strong cybersecurity capabilities.
2. IDLE (Pythonâ€™s Default IDE) - Basic, lightweight, suitable for testing.
3. OpenCV  (pip install opencv-python) - For advanced image and video steganography.
4. Stegano -  Python library for hiding messages in images.
5. Github - Version control and collaboration for security projects.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of steganography by embedding and extracting hidden messages within images. It serves as a foundation for further research and development in secure communication techniques. Future improvements can enhance security and usability, making it a more robust solution for discreet data transmission.
